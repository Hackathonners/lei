    JGraphT if you are more interested in data structures and algorithms.
    JGraph if your primary focus is visualization.
    Jung, yWorks, and BFG are other things people tried using.
    Prefuse is a no no since one has to rewrite most of it.
    Google Guava if you need good datastructures only.
    Apache Commons Graph. Currently dormant, but provides implementations for many algorithms. See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SANDBOX-458 for a list of implemented algorithms, also compared with Jung, GraphT, Prefuse, jBPT
